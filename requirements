Per the requirement pc0 has been configured corretly.

Possible questions 
CDM problem meaning 
1)is it a configuration problem
is it a corrupt system 
is the Ip Stack good 
Have we been attacked by a malware 
2)Is it a physical problem 
i.e 
is the cable working
is the nic not working 
is it the port on the switch  

to check the problem 
>ipconfig /all 
and compare to the working system with the correct configuration 
hint 
In case of laptop0 everything except the ip_address is incorrect or not configured properly.
The third octect number is 2 instead of 1
